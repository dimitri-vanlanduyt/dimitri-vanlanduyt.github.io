Participant ID,Assumption ID,Summary
1 ,A10,Data flow between PDS and mail provide is secure
1 ,A6,PDS users cannot claim that they havent received a document because it is very for edocs to check whether the document is in the PDS
1 ,A7,PDS users can change their information after logging in
1 ,A8,No harm can be done creating a new user for the PDS regarding tampering or information disclosure since it would involve your own PDS
1 ,A9,It is impossible to register a new user if the username or emailaddress are already in use
2 ,A10,the delivery manager and scheduler are deployed on the same physical node
2 ,A11,the PDS docs and PDS user data are deployed on the same physical node
2 ,A12,External delivery services are assumed to be professionally enough and have proper authentication handling
2 ,A13,PDS user logs in via browser and uses credentials
2 ,A14,A13+ visits of a user to the PDS are logged
2 ,A6,The document ID cannot be guessed and an adversary cannot change the delivery status of documents as a consequence
2 ,A7,The delivery scheduler has no flows going outside the trust boundary (+A1)
2 ,A8,the generated docs archive has no flow going outside the trust boundary
3 ,A10,No authentication when creating a new PDS user
3 ,A11,Tampering with documents is not possible as they are not changed after creationg and customer organisations are not considered here
3 ,A12,Tampering with user dara is not considered except for threat T6 in which is the info is tampered with at creation
3 ,A13,Information disclosure of PDS user data is considered impossible as the PDS proces (p3) never sends it anywhere and itis safe angainst code & memory level attacks
3 ,A14,All information sent over channels in the trust boundary (DF11-DF23) is either over internal infrastructure or encrypted. As such the data can not be tampered with or be discoed as edocs employees are considered trustworthy
3 ,A17,Information disclosure through sidechannels is considered nowehere as the difficulty for such an attack would make it not the worth it for edocs data
3 ,A18,"As logs are never mentioned in the description of the edocs system, it is assumed no logs are kept"

47 ,A7,"The likelihood of E1,E2 or E3 denying that they have received the documents is low"
47 ,A9,The likelihood of the encryption keys for the flows DF1-DF3 being stolen from the external services is low
48 ,A10,The data stores are considered free from tampering or disclosure because they are used only by processes from within the trust boundary
48 ,A11,The information in DF5 isnt of much value so the likeliness of disclosion (sic) is low
48 ,A12,The delivery scheduler (P2) is free from threats; it's only used by the components within the trust boundary 
48 ,A13,The PDS process(P3) checks whether the user request if valid (e.g. can not request files from other users) against tampering and disclosure
48 ,A14,The likelihood of tampering with DF5 is low because it has low impact (nothing can be gained by the attack)
48 ,A6,"T and ID threats are not applicalbe for DF1-3,6-10 because these data flows are encrypted"
48 ,A7,Tampering with the document sent via mail (DF4) is difficult because the documents are encrypted with the private key of the sender
48 ,A8,"The external print and zoomit service handle their credentials for authenticating with eDocs with care, so that it's very hard to obtain these"

52 ,A14,"The data flow internal of the eDocs system (DF11-DF23) are all happening within local area network, so we dont consider them to be tampered"
52 ,A15,"Since data flow (DF11-DF20) all contains very similar assets (documents,ids, statuses) and it's apparently easier to observe data flow between PDS and a data store (DF19,DF20). So I assume DF19 and DF20 are easier to be attacked. Therefore DF11-DF18 has low priority for ID threats"
52 ,A17,"Data flow between PDS and User data store (DFS21-DS23) should have higher priority than DF19 and DF20, because user data is much easier to make use. And since the attacker gets user data,it's easier for the attacker to login to PDS and get specific documents of these users."

89 ,A14,PDS users can remove documents from their overview
89 ,A15,"Attacker could mail E1,E2, E4 with an email that ressembles edocs email saying it has lost its credentials. We assume that E1,E2,E3 are good enough programmed to no send credentials to a resembling address"
89 ,A17,"If a user forgets his password to the PDS, his password is emailed to him"
89 ,A18,The deliverers have no way of distinguishing messages that are already sent and new messages
89 ,A6,"Edocs logins by credentials to zoomit,email provider, print service, and sends them their documents to be sent"
89 ,A7,"The print service, zoomit, email provider only send documents. We assume that they want to have high profits so they wont say that they havent sent a document and miss a billing opportunity"
89 ,A8,A PDS user is authenticated by means of credentials
89 ,A9,DF4 and DF5 do not have any encryption
90 ,A10,We assume there are no logs held for the PDS userś interaction with the PDS
90 ,A11,We assume that either DF9 or DF10 is responsible for receipt notification
90 ,A12,"We assume for DF12, DF13, DF15,DF19 and DF20 that the document itself is sent, not a document id that is later used for document retrieval"
90 ,A13,"We assume for DF12, DF13, DF15,DF19 and DF20 that the document is not used for "
90 ,A14,"We assume only requests are sent in DF11, no documents"
90 ,A15,"For dataflow DF14, we assume only limited request can be made (status) so impact and likelihood are very low"
90 ,A16,"We assume for DF16, only minor data can be sent"
90 ,A17,"We assume tthat the DS2, DS3 and P3 are thightly coupled so the likelihood of breaking in the DB is almost zero"
90 ,A18,"We assume the internal working of P1,P2, and P3 are complex enough they cant be spoofed without recognition"
90 ,A6,The PDS user has received credentials at registration and uses them for authentication
90 ,A7,"For E1,E2,E3 we assume there is a good SLA and consider them services that are trustworthy"
90 ,A8,We assume that for DF4 and DF5 that the communicaion occurs with a simple SMTP servier that is not secure and easily hacked
90 ,A9,"We assume that for DF5, the email provider only sends deliverer notifications and receipt tracking info"
91 ,A10,The print service has taken security measures to prevent the takeover of its system
91 ,A11,Spoofing an email provider only results in being able to park documents as sent. This is no useful functionality for an attacker
91 ,A12,A PDS user is authenticated by means of credentials
91 ,A13,The delivery scheduler is not connected durectly to systems outside of eDocs 
91 ,A14,"The generated documents are valid info for the delivery scheduler, no input validation is necessary (P1)"
91 ,A15,The delivery scheduler does not deny having sent or received documents
91 ,A16,The delivery scheduler can only communicate with parts of the eDocs system. No design-level information disclosure is possible
91 ,A17,"No tampering is possible with DF1 when using strong encryption (also for DF2, and DF3)"
91 ,A18,Communication goes over the public Internet
91 ,A19,Email traffic is not encrypted
91 ,A20,Email traffic is sent over the public internet
91 ,A6,"The spoofing of a print service (E1) is not applicable, since the system knows the correct delivery on only sends info to it"
91 ,A7,The print service has seigned a legally binding SLA specifiying it will print and send documents
91 ,A8,Zoomit has signed a legally binding SLA specifying it will deliver the documents it receives
91 ,A9,Zoomit has taken security measures to prevent the takeover of its system
92 ,A6,"DS3 passwords are not stored in plain text, with hash and salt -> even when attackers get access no immediate harm is done"
92 ,A7,"When entities deny they received the data that was sent to them, it is sent again"
92 ,A8,Data sent between PDS and PDS User data is encrypted so that this very sensitive information cannot be read in data flow
94 ,A7,Queries to the PDS datastore are not authenticated
