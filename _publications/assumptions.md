Assumption-making is an integral part of security by design and plays a significant role in scoping the efforts. However, it is often not of focus.
An in-depth descriptive study was been performed to gain a better understanding of the role and common use of assumptions in the use of STRIDE. 

The first study is based on a data set created by collecting the assumptions made by students performing STRIDE, and augmented with a number of assumptions made by experts.
Both data sets can be downloaded below.
